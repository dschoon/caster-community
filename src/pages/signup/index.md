### Engaged Members
Our goal is to build a community that is highly engaged, and highly supportive of one another. If you aren't interested in contributing to the combined success of your fellow members, our community isn't the place for you. 

### Podcast Fans
Our community is centered around podcasting, but don't worry, it's not required that you have a podcast to join! Our members are all passionate about podcasts though, and while we discuss many personal topics, we try to keep conversations focused on the topic.

### A Welcoming Place
We want you to always feel safe opening up and sharing the obstacles you're facing. Because of this, we reserve the right to remove access to any community member who is not upholding their end of our community aggreement. We have a strict zero tolerance policy when it comes to treating other community members poorly.
